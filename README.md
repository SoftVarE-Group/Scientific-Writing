# Lectures on Scientific Writing

The repository contains slides for lectures on scientific writing as held at the University of Ulm to teach undergraduate students in Computer Science, but could also be helpful for other disciplines. The course has been created from scratch in April and May 2021. In 2022, we started to split the course into three parts devoted to Proseminar (Scientific Writing 1), Bachelor's Seminar (Scientific Writing 2), and Master's Seminar (Scientific Writing 3). The goal is to update the slides on a yearly basis. If you have any feedback, please contact the main author [Thomas Th√ºm](mailto:thomas.thuem@uni-ulm.de).
